## Welcome to OpenGenomeBrowser 
 
**ALERT: This software is still under development! If you want to try it out, contact the developer first!**

**Prototype:** [opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/)

To talk to the developer informally, join the OpenGenomeBrowser [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/mDm4fqf).

_OpenGenomeBrowser is a dynamic and scalable web platform for comparative genomics._

-   OpenGenomeBrowser automates simple bioinformatics steps:
    - Dendrograms (Taxid-based, ANI-based and OrthoFinder-based)
    - Searching for annotations in genomes
    - Visualizing genomes on KEGG maps
    - BLAST
    - Visualisation of gene loci
-   OpenGenomeBrowser has few prerequisites:
    - Genome files must be stored in certain folder structure
    - One metadata file for each genome and organism
-   OpenGenomeBrowser is flexible:
    - Orthofinder is recommended, but not required
    - Computationally intensive processes can be outsourced to a cluster

### Key concepts

-   _Organism_: biological entity
-   _Genome_: sequencing variant
-   _Representative_: best genome of organism
