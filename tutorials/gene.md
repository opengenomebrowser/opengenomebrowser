This page allows you to look at a gene in more detail. Click [here](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/gene/FAM19471-i1-1.1_001004/)
for an example.

You will be able to see:

*   its annotations
*   its nucleotide sequence
*   its protein sequence (unless the gene does not have a protein sequence, e.g. tRNAs)
*   information from the GenBank file
*   an interactive gene locus view
