# Genomes table

First, let's explore the genomes table. Click on [`Genomes`](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/genomes).

This page contains powerful filter and search options.
  - Columns can be sorted and filtered by clicking on the column header.

To dive deeper into a genome, open the context menu: **right click** on a row.
  - This is an exception: elsewhere on OpenGenomeBrowser, a normal **left click** opens the context menu.

It is possible to select **multiple** genomes by holding down `Shift` and/or `Ctrl`, then clicking on rows.
  - The context menu (right click!) will look different and have more options if multiple genomes are selected.

The settings sidebar can be opened by clicking on the settings wheel. It provides the following options:
  - The table, in the current view, can be downloaded in CSV or Excel format.
  - By default, only `representative` genomes are shown. This can be changed in the settings sidebar.
  - Genomes that are marked `restricted` or `contaminated` are hidden by default. This can be changed in the settings sidebar.
  - Additional metadata columns may be added by moving a field from "available columns" to "visible columns". To submit the changes, click on "Update table".
