# Pathways

The [pathways page](https://opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/pathway/) can be accessed from the genomes table or the 'expand'-button on the top of the page.

Select a pathway map by entering a search query, for example `citrate cycle`, and selecting a map of interest. On the demo server, all available KEGG-ko-maps are loaded into the website. Next, select one or more genomes. Click on submit.

The resulting colored pathway map can be downloaded by clicking on the settings wheel, and then on `Save as PNG` or `Save as SVG`.

Click on a shape to learn which genomes cover the contained annotations.

Click on a covered annotation, then on ` Compare the genes of this annotation` to see sequence alignments or compare the gene loci.
